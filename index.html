        <p> I draw everyday. It calms me and I really like doing it. I usually draw in my free time. I like that you can draw anything in any shape, color, size, and texture. I started drawing when I was very little. I've always loved drawing. What is your favorite color or most common used color to use when you are drawing? Mine is deep sky blue. Do you like drawing? </p>
